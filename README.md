# Resting state fMRI time series data

The script loads the subset of processed resting state fMRI data used in study

## M.K. Chung, S. Das, and H. Ombao. Dynamic topological data analysis of functional human brain networks. Foundations of Data Science, 6:22â€“40, 2024. 

The project is funded by NIH MH133614.



The data set is also used in publication:

Huang, S.-G., Samdin, S.B., Ting, C.M., Ombao, H., Chung, M.K. 
2020 Statistical model for dynamically-changing correlation matrices 
with application to brain connectivity. Journal of Neuroscience Methods 331:108480

The data went through the minimal preprocssing related to head motions:
FD based motion correction, scrubing and imputation. Also the data is centered to the mean since every 
subject has different baseline of brain activation. Other image processing such as bandpass filtering and basis expansion are not applied. 
If you are using the data for publication, please reference the paper above and github site.
